This project consists of the following files:
1. packet.h - Contains the declaration of the packet structure and the serialization and deserialization functions.

2. client/client.cpp - Contains the code for the client.
	Usage: ./client.o hostname filename

3. server/server.cpp - Contains the code for the server.
	Usage: ./server.o

4. server/test*.txt - 4 files for testing file sending. File sizes are 10KB, 61B, and 10MB respectively.

5. Makefile - For building the project's executables.

For this part of the project, I changed my implementation to C++ so that I can use the STL
for priority_queue, unordered_map and queue implementations.

In my project, multithreading and transmission using multiple sockets is complete.
The window size is also dynamic and increases and decreases in accordance with the 
AIMD mechanism. The code for dropping packets is currently disabled. File ordering is also
implemented and works as expected.
